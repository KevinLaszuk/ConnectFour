# ðŸŽ¯ Connect Four in React

Welcome to my React-based **Connect Four** game! This project is a modern recreation of the classic two-player strategy game using **ReactJS**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It focuses on building a fully functional, interactive board game with core logic implemented in React components.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This React app replicates the classic Connect Four game where two players (Player 1 and Player 2) take turns dropping colored discs into a 6-row by 7-column grid. The first player to connect four discs in a row â€” vertically, horizontally, or diagonally â€” wins!

### ðŸŽ® Gameplay Rules

- "Yellow" (Player 1) starts first.
- Players alternate turns.
- Discs stack from the bottom up in each column.
- First to connect four discs wins.
- If the board fills with no winner, it's a draw.
- A full column will not accept more discs and will show an alert.
